Project Showcase: Custom PCB & Circuit Design for Robotic Sensor Array
This document details the design and development of a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the sensor array used in my autonomous robotics projects. The decision to move from a breadboard prototype to a custom PCB was driven by the need for enhanced reliability, a compact form factor, and a more professional, robust final product.

1. Design Motivation & Objectives
Prototyping on breadboards is excellent for initial testing, but it suffers from issues like loose connections and signal noise, which are critical failure points in a fast-moving robot.

The primary objectives for designing a custom PCB were:

Improve Reliability: Eliminate wiring errors and ensure all components have secure, soldered connections.

Optimize Form Factor: Create a compact, custom-shaped board that integrates seamlessly with the robot's chassis.

Enhance Signal Integrity: Reduce electronic noise by creating direct, optimized paths for signals and implementing power/ground planes.

Professionalism: Develop a finished product that demonstrates end-to-end hardware design skills.

2. Circuit Design & Schematic
The circuit is designed as an array of IR (Infrared) sensors for line detection. Each sensor unit consists of:

An IR LED which acts as a transmitter, emitting infrared light onto the surface below the robot.

A Phototransistor which acts as a receiver. Its conductivity changes based on the amount of infrared light it receives.

Operating Principle:

When the sensor is over a white surface, most of the IR light is reflected, causing the phototransistor to conduct heavily.

When over a black surface, most of the IR light is absorbed, and the phototransistor's conductivity drops significantly.

This change is read as a digital or analog signal by the microcontroller, allowing the robot to "see" the line. The circuit includes current-limiting resistors for the LEDs and pull-up/pull-down resistors for the phototransistors to ensure stable readings.

3. PCB Layout & Routing
The PCB was designed using Eagle CAD. The process involved translating the schematic into a physical layout.

Key Design Considerations:

Component Placement: The IR sensors were arranged in an arc to provide a wide field of view for detecting the line, allowing the robot to anticipate curves.

Trace Routing: Signal traces (in blue) were kept as short and direct as possible. Power traces (in red) were made wider to handle current demands.

Ground Plane: A copper pour (or ground plane) was considered to provide a common ground reference, which is crucial for reducing noise and improving signal integrity.

Ergonomics: Mounting holes were included for easy and secure attachment to the robot chassis.

Final PCB Layouts
