# Line-Follower
An end-to-end robotics project showcasing the design and build of autonomous line-following and maze-solving robots. This project integrates custom PCB design, sensor fusion (IR, ToF), and advanced control algorithms like PID in C++/Arduino to achieve highspeed, precise navigation. A deep dive in embedded systems from concept to a finished product.
