# Line-Follower
An end-to-end robotics project showcasing the design and build of autonomous line-following and maze-solving robots. This project integrates custom PCB design, sensor fusion (IR, ToF), and advanced control algorithms like PID in C++/Arduino to achieve highspeed, precise navigation. A deep dive in embedded systems from concept to a finished product.

Project Showcase:
Autonomous Line Following & Maze Solving Robots
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the design, development, and implementation of a series of autonomous robots built for line following and maze navigation challenges. This project represents a deep dive into embedded systems, sensor integration, and control theory.

Project Motivation & Goals
The primary goal of this project was to apply theoretical knowledge of electronics and programming to a practical, hands-on application. I aimed to develop a robust and versatile robotic platform from the ground up, focusing on the following key objectives:

Master Control Systems: Implement and fine-tune a PID control algorithm for high-speed, precise navigation.

Develop Sensor Fusion Techniques: Integrate data from multiple different sensors to create a reliable perception of the robot's environment.

End-to-End Product Design: Manage the entire project lifecycle, from initial concept and hardware design to software development, testing, and refinement.

Design & Development Process
The project was developed iteratively, starting with a basic line follower and progressively adding complexity and new features.

Hardware Prototyping: The initial phase involved prototyping on a breadboard to test individual components (sensors, motors, drivers) and validate the core design.

Custom PCB Design: To improve reliability and create a more professional, compact form factor, a custom PCB was designed in Eagle. This involved creating schematics, routing traces, and ensuring proper power distribution for all components.

Software Architecture: The software was written in C++ on the Arduino platform. The logic was built around a main control loop that continuously processes sensor data, runs the navigation algorithms (PID or maze-solving), and sends commands to the motor driver.

Tuning and Calibration: A significant amount of time was dedicated to calibrating the sensors and tuning the PID controller's parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd) to achieve optimal performanceâ€”balancing speed with stability and minimizing overshoot.

Key Features & Technical Breakdown
Precise Line Following: Utilizes a finely-tuned PID control algorithm to accurately track lines, allowing for smooth navigation through complex courses.

Intelligent Maze Navigation: Employs a wall-following algorithm (e.g., left-hand rule) with IR and ToF sensors to systematically solve mazes.

Multi-Sensor Integration: Fuses data from LSA08 digital line arrays, IR proximity sensors, and ToF distance sensors for robust environmental awareness.

Custom Hardware: The core of the robot is a custom-designed PCB that integrates the microcontroller, motor driver, and sensor connections into a single, reliable board.

Core Technologies Used:
Languages & Platforms: C++, Arduino

Hardware: Arduino Uno/Nano, ESP32, LSA08 & IR Sensors, ToF Sensors, DC Motors, L298N Driver

Design Tools: Eagle, KiCad, VS Code with PlatformIO

Results & Learning Outcomes
This project was successful in achieving all its primary goals. The final robot is capable of navigating complex line-following courses at high speed and reliably solving standard mazes.

Key learning outcomes include:

Practical Application of Control Theory: Gained invaluable hands-on experience implementing and tuning PID controllers.

Embedded Systems Design: Mastered the process of designing, fabricating, and debugging custom hardware for a specific application.

Algorithm Development: Enhanced problem-solving skills by developing and refining algorithms for real-world navigation challenges.
